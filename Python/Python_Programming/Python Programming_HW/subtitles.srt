1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,040
明明有其他空牢房  你偏要把他們關在一起
You had another cell. You threw them in with him.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,800
你算什么警察
What the hell kind of cop are you?

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,060
{\an8}前情提要

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,860
你哥昨天被抓了
Your brother was arrested yesterday.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,160
被告方有何辯護
How does the defendant plea?

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,430
無罪  法官閣下
Not guilty, your honor.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,010
肯定挺費勁的
Could be a lot of work, I imagine.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,970
要是把這么一大家子人都埋了  我們不會作證
Burying a family this large. We will not testify.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,500
被告當庭釋放
The defendant is free to go.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,930
我以為我再也見不到你了
I didn't think I'd see you again.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,580
這座城市正處于暴風雨前的寧靜
This city is becoming a powder keg.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,280
到時你不得不站隊
You're gonna have to pick your poison.

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,460
此事絕不容忍
This will not stand!

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,070
你就不該去那
You've got no business being out there at all.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,800
把手放下
Drop your hands.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,170
咱倆  兩清了吧
You and me, we're square now, right?

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,720
你該擔心的不是這個  比爾
You've got bigger concerns, Bill.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,590
我要在街上見血
I'll need to see blood in the streets.

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,110
不  你們干什么
No! What are you doing?

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,230
帶上家人  今晚就離開舊金山
Take your family, and leave San Francisco tonight.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,580
方塊7

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,330
我要籌碼
I'm gonna need a marker.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,360
你聽見了嗎
Did you hear me?

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,750
我說要籌碼
I said I need a marker.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,490
有什么問題嗎
What's the trouble here?

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,080
-杰克·達蒙  -比爾·歐哈拉
- Jack Damon. - Bill O'Hara.

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,130
天啊
Jesus.

28
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,020
你怎么跑這來了
What the hell are you doing here?

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,210
我聽說你離開軍隊
I heard you left the force

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,990
去芝加哥的平克頓偵探社了
to ride with the Pinkertons out in Chicago.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,260
那邊太冷了
It's too fucking cold out there.

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
我秋天回舊金山了
I came back to San Francisco in the fall.

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,730
弗拉納根容不下我
Flannagan didn't have a slot for me,

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,810
所以我就來這了
so I ended up here.

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,960
你在這里工作
You work here?

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,020
豐海的金錢也一樣閃閃發光
Fung Hai gold shines as bright as anyone's.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,800
你能讓他們拿籌碼給我嗎
Well, um, can you get them to stake me?

38
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,610
當然  五十夠嗎
Sure. How's about 50?

39
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,730
五十可以
Yeah, 50's good.

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,270
五十
50?

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,330
好運  比爾
Good luck, Bill.

42
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,250
紅心4

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,800
太棒了
Come on!

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,650
對不起各位
Sorry, fellas.

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,410
今晚不走運啊
Sometimes it's just not your night.

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,900
贏了不少啊
Nice pile.

47
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,470
相信我  剛才我還欠錢的
Believe me, I was due.

48
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,830
現在趕緊兌現吧
You know, now might be the right time to cash out.

49
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,570
盆盈缽滿地回家
Go home with your pockets full.

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,640
我正準備這么做
And that is exactly what I'm gonna do

51
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,880
等這輪結束的
just as soon as this action cools.

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,090
來吧  繼續轉
Let's go. Keep it spinning.

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,760
好吧  比爾
Okay, Bill.

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,660
請下注

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,340
黑桃1

56
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,500
我玩完了
I think I'm done.

57
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,000
-今晚不順嗎  -莊家作弊了
- Rough night? - Table's rigged.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,750
真像個賭徒
Spoken like a true gambler.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,140
來吧  我送你出去
Come on, I'll walk you out.

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,180
-我能還上籌碼  -我知道  比爾
- I'm good for my marker. - I know you are, Bill.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,680
喘口氣  比爾
Short breaths, Bill.

62
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,410
放輕松
Easy, now.

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,900
我給你介紹一下豐海
Let me tell you something about the Fung Hai.

64
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,460
他們自稱是成吉思汗的直系后代
They believe they're direct descendants of Genghis Khan.

65
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,800
你知道蒙古人吧
You know the Mongols, right?

66
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,900
歷史上最大的帝國
Biggest empire in the history.

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,530
總之蒙古人
Anyway, the Mongols.

68
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,440
他們從平原策馬而來  就像一群
hey came riding out of the plains like...

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
惡魔
Demons.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,050
掠奪整個城市
Pillaging whole cities.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,460
如今中國人需要了解他們的敵人  對嗎
Now the Chinese, they need to understand their enemy, right?

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,880
所以皇帝派他的偵察兵去
So the Emperor sends his scouts out

73
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,490
蒙古平原
to the Mongolian plains,

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,180
他們到了那里  往遠處望去
and they get out there, and in the distance,

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,470
他們看到這座
they see this...

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,330
白色山峰
white mountain

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,500
拔地而起
rising up where no mountain should be.

78
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,690
他們離這座山越來越近
They get closer to this mountain,

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,080
你知道他們發現了什么嗎
and do you know what they find?

80
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,700
白骨
Bones.

81
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,700
一整座白骨山
An entire mountain of bones.

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
成千上萬的白骨
Hundreds of thousands of skeletons

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,720
爛成一堆
just rotting on a fucking pile.

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,860
那時他們才知道在和誰打交道
That's when they understood who they were dealing with...

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,130
你在和誰打交道
who you're dealing with.

86
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,910
豐海有個問題
The Fung Hai had a problem.

87
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,490
中國賭徒欠他們錢時
When a chink gambler owes them,

88
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,390
他們會打斷他的腿  威脅他的家人  但
they can break his legs, threaten his family, but...

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,790
當愛爾蘭人欠債后
what are they supposed to do when an Irishman runs up a debt

90
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,220
卻一走了之
and then runs back down the hill

91
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,630
他們該怎么辦
when it comes time to pay?

92
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,240
老達蒙就上場了
That's where old Damon comes in.

93
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,290
我可以做到他們不能做的
See, I can go where they can't--

94
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,040
殺一儆百
make an example of someone,

95
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,450
確保每個人都知道代價
make sure everyone knows the toll.

96
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,120
就算警察也逃不掉豐海的債
Not even a cop escapes a Fung Hai debt.

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,770
你怎么混到這份上了
How do you live with yourself,

98
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
做中國佬的打手
being a stick boy for the chinks?

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,550
我不喜歡這樣  比爾
I take no pleasure in it, Bill.

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,230
但我在那里為你擔保了
But I vouched for you in there,

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,930
所以你要付錢
so you're going to pay up.

102
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,070
標準期限為兩周
Standard window is two weeks.

103
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,680
我給警察一個特惠
I'll give you the policeman's special:

104
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,580
三周
three weeks.

105
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,460
之后
After that...

106
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,540
你就要去白骨山一游了
You're taking a trip to the white mountain.

107
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,920
去你媽的  達蒙
Fuck you, Damon.

108
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,440
三周  比爾
Three weeks, Bill.

109
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,970
{\an8}第一季  第四集

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,850
{\an8}市廳警察

111
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,320
早啊  阿杉
Morning, Ah Sahm.

112
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,370
-早啊  -早上好  阿杉
- Morning. - Morning, Ah Sahm.

113
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,620
時間到了
Hey, about time!

114
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,360
-感覺怎么樣  -呼吸時才會疼
- How's it feel? - It only hurts when I breathe.

115
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,740
還有坐下時
And sit.

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,590
你覺得這就算糟糕嗎
You think that's bad?

117
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,100
看看這個
Look at this.

118
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,280
我總是隨身攜帶
I always carry it with me.

119
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,190
讓我想起去過的地方
Reminds me of where I've been.

120
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,940
這是什么
What is it?

121
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,140
一枚鐵路道釘
It's a railroad spike.

122
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,270
博洛曾在洲際鐵路工作
Bolo used to work on the Transcontinental.

123
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
你當過苦力
You were a coolie?

124
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,430
猶他
Utah.

125
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,110
夏天熱得要命
Hot as hell in the summer.

126
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,810
冬天冷死人
Cold as fuck in the winter.

127
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,320
沒過多久美國佬
It didn't take long for the ducks to find

128
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,620
就發現了他的長處
a better use for him.

129
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,230
你在和傳奇人物說話
You're talking to a legend, man.

130
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,990
大約十年前
About ten years ago,

131
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,400
據說有個強大的中國人
word spread of a giant Chinaman

132
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,310
在斯康鐵路上戰斗
fighting on the Transcon circuit.

133
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,530
他無人能敵
There was no one he couldn't take down.

134
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,180
他們稱之為黃魔
They called him "The Yellow Demon."

135
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,710
閉嘴吧  小尊
Shut the fuck up, Baby Jun.

136
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,940
黃魔
"The Yellow Demon"?

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,210
我父親想親眼目睹一下
My father had to see it for himself,

138
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,340
所以他大老遠跑到猶他州
so he travelled all the way to Utah

139
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,080
就為好好看一眼這個所謂的惡魔
to get a better look at this so-called demon.

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,780
那只不過是又一場
It was just another game

141
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,060
供無聊的白豬賭錢的游戲
for the bored white fucks to bet on.

142
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,710
殺人能拿雙份錢
They paid the fighters double for kills,

143
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,260
黃魔每次都會拿到這筆獎金
and the Yellow Demon always got that bonus.

144
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,270
我父親
My father...

145
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,100
不能容忍讓美國佬
couldn't stand the thought of some duck

146
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,710
利用博洛賺錢
getting rich off Bolo's back,

147
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,840
所以把他買下來了
so he bought him.

148
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,350
"把他買下來了"是什么意思
What do you mean, "bought him"?

149
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,720
像買頂帽子嗎
Like a hat?

150
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,460
別自欺欺人了
Don't kid yourself.

151
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,240
你這臭蔥頭的命是尊爺的
Father Jun owns your onion ass,

152
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,100
我們的命都是他的
just like he owns the rest of us.

153
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,300
來吧  你看起來糟透了
Come on, you look like shit.

154
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,010
我有東西能幫上忙
I've got something that will help with that.

155
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,890
總有一天
One of these days,

156
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,520
咱倆應該過幾招
you and I should go a few rounds...

157
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,780
試試身手
see what's what.

158
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,450
跟黃魔打
Fight the Yellow Demon?

159
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,770
我瘋了嗎
Do I look crazy?

160
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,800
注意
Ten-hut.

161
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,370
副市長先生  早上好
Mr. Deputy Mayor. Good morning.

162
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,400
弗拉納根局長  我知道你是個大忙人
Chief Flannagan, I know you're a busy man,

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,780
所以我就直說了
so I'll get right to it.

164
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,790
我想你一定和我一樣
I am sure you were as disappointed as I was

165
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,860
對法官決定釋放
in the judge's decision

166
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,540
你手下抓到的惡徒一事感到失望
to cut loose the highbinder your men arrested.

167
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,610
這他媽就是嘲弄  就是這樣
It was a fucking travesty, is what it was.

168
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,500
你一定能想象到  我們有一群憤怒的選民
As you can imagine, we have a very angry constituency

169
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,770
在要求伸張正義
demanding justice.

170
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,100
-毫無疑問  -局長
- No doubt. - Chief,

171
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,890
你干這行很久了
you've been at it a long time.

172
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,220
二十五年
25 years.

173
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,890
我想說的是  像你這么有經驗的人
My point is, a man of your experience knows

174
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,650
明白我們的法庭  法官和法律
that from time to time, our courts, judges--

175
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,360
有時候不能伸張真正的正義
our laws can fail to deliver true justice.

176
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
這種時候  就需要我們行政部門
At those times, it falls to us in the executive branch

177
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,410
負責收拾殘局  可以這么說
to pick up the slack, as it were.

178
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,380
我記得這段對話開始時
As I recall, you started this conversation

179
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,880
你說要"有話直說"
by saying you planned to get "right to it."

180
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,010
中國城的暴力是持續存在的問題
Violence in Chinatown is an ongoing problem.

181
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,540
但如果蔓延到中國城之外
When it spills out of Chinatown,

182
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,630
我們就不能容忍了
that is something we cannot tolerate.

183
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,060
市長想要殺雞儆猴
The mayor would like to send a message.

184
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,860
那么
And, uh,

185
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,780
市長有看上的地點嗎
does the mayor have any particular venue in mind?

186
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,140
那好吧
All right, then.

187
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,750
李子  比爾去哪了
Leeds! Where the hell is Bill?

188
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,960
我們要的是殺手
We ask for killers...

189
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,910
結果只有這種貨色
and this is what we get.

190
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,960
悠著點  伙計  這玩意勁大
Go easy, man. This shit kicks.

191
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,840
-里面加了什么  -只是一點點鴉片膏
- What's in this? - It's just a kiss of molasses.

192
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,140
特殊情況下我才會這么卷
I only roll them on special occasions...

193
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,070
今天的情況就是我爸昨晚
the occasion here being the major up-fuckery

194
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,900
狠揍了你一頓
my father laid on you last night.

195
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,880
知道嗎  我的比你更慘
Mine was worse, you know.

196
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,460
我的入堂儀式被他打斷兩根骨頭
Broke two bones in his own hands skinning me in.

197
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,250
真見鬼
Fucking hell.

198
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,510
他不想讓人覺得有所偏袒
He didn't want to show any favoritism.

199
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,980
你知道你能相信我吧
You know you can trust me, right?

200
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,960
-我知道  -很好
- I know. - Good.

201
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,190
因為我比看上去要聰明
'Cause I'm smarter than I look.

202
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,900
你必須得聰明才行
Well, you'd have to be.

203
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,950
去你的  你個狗逼
Fuck off, you dog cunt.

204
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,350
你為什么來這里
Why are you here?

205
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,330
別告訴我是為了麻煙
And don't tell me it's for the chop.

206
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,460
像你這么能打的人
A guy who can scrap like you

207
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,450
不需要跨海來掙錢
doesn't need to cross the salt to get paid.

208
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,400
我來找一個人
I came to find someone.

209
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,420
那個姑娘
The girl.

210
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,130
我就知道
I knew it!

211
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,660
好吧  但是不能每次我一扭頭
Well, now, I can't have you fucking off every time

212
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,920
-你就不見了...  -她死了
- I turn around-- - She's dead.

213
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,040
她死了
She's dead.

214
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,240
對
Yeah.

215
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,540
你跨過大海
You cross the salt.

216
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,770
結果她死了
She ends up dead.

217
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,910
現在你入堂了
Now you're skinned in.

218
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,850
你可真倒霉
Sucks for you.

219
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,800
我也不知道
I don't know, uh...

220
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,500
我一個人過了很長時間
I've been on my own for a while...

221
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,310
所以很高興知道有人挺我
so it's kind of good to know someone has my back.

222
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,470
這么想就對了
That's the spirit.

223
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,760
你知道  這是雙向的
Works both ways, you know.

224
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,690
-什么  -信任
- What? - Trust.

225
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,480
我需要知道我能信任你
I need to know I can trust you.

226
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,700
你能
You can.

227
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,080
這玩意讓我頭暈
This shit is making me woozy.

228
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,740
我去走走
I'm gonna go walk it off.

229
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,240
沒問題
Sure.

230
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,210
別再從我面前消失就行
Just don't go disappearing on me again.

231
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,980
我想你一定會喜歡這個
I think you're really gonna like this.

232
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,520
我不是來買東西的
I'm not here to shop.

233
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,980
反正也來了  順便看一眼
But you are here, so just take a look.

234
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,340
你看
See that?

235
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,910
假如你發現自己陷入困境
Now, suppose you find yourself in a tight spot.

236
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,380
砰
Bang.

237
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
你學得很快
You learn fast.

238
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,520
我給你個好價錢
I'll give you a good price.

239
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,280
別再跟我推銷了
Stop trying to sell me.

240
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,340
我是來找你談豐海的
I came here to talk to you about the Fung Hai.

241
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,640
豐海
Fung Hai?

242
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,660
我需要你安排會面
I need you to set a meeting.

243
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,820
豐海
Fung Hai.

244
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,870
聽我說
Now, look...

245
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,680
我知道你需要新的打手來收尾
I know you need new scissor boys to help round things out,

246
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,200
這我可以幫你
and I can help you with that.

247
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,150
-但是豐海...  -阿舟
- But the Fung Hai... - Chao.

248
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,640
你知道  他們建起長城
You know, they built the Great Wall

249
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,010
就是為了阻擋像豐海那幫人一樣的野蠻人
to keep out savages like the Fung Hai.

250
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,900
相信我  跟他們打交道沒有好下場
Trust me, no good will come from dealing with them.

251
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,380
如果我是來征求你的意見的
And if I'd come for your advice,

252
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,500
一定很樂意和你爭論  但我不是
I'm sure I'd love the debate, but I didn't.

253
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
我是來讓你安排會面的
See, what I did do was ask you to set a meeting.

254
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,940
你可以答應  然后掙到賞錢
So you can say yes and earn your fee

255
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,290
和我的謝意  或者你可以拒絕
and my gratitude, or you can say no

256
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,610
然后空手而歸
and earn neither.

257
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,150
好  行
Sure. Okay.

258
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,280
請盡快安排
As soon as possible, please.

259
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,190
你自己看
See for yourself.

260
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,530
他一團糟
He's a mess.

261
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,300
被苦力打個半死  黎明時候才回來
Came home at dawn beaten half to death by coolies.

262
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,170
我跟你說了
I already told you,

263
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,200
他們的下場比我慘得多
they fared much worse by the time it was over.

264
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
我沒想到他們會偷襲我  就這樣
I was caught by surprise, that's all.

265
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,920
我沒想到的是
The only surprise here

266
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,690
你還能活下來繼續騙我
is that you're still alive to lie about it.

267
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,710
現在我有點后悔活下來了
And right about now, I'm wishing I wasn't.

268
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,910
老天  有人把你
God, somebody jumped on you

269
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,180
胖揍了一頓啊
with all four feet, didn't they?

270
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,470
按理說隊長不用值夜班吧
You'd think the head of a squad wouldn't work the night shift.

271
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,710
別糾纏不休了  我說了我沒事
Quit your badgering. I said I'm fine.

272
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,950
對  你說的話多了去了  比爾
Yes, you say a lot of things, Bill.

273
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,600
你呢  你當時怎么沒和他在一起
And you? Why weren't you there with him?

274
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,040
別煩他  他這周都值了三個夜班了
Leave him alone! He's had three night shifts this week!

275
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,270
抱歉  李先生  我就是覺得太過分了
Sorry, Mr. Lee, I just think it's unconscionable,

276
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,080
派他晚上獨自一人去那種地方
sending him into that place alone at night.

277
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,460
相信我  歐哈拉太太  你再說也無濟于事
Believe me, Mrs. O'Hara, you're preaching to the choir.

278
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,400
我們已經跟局長說過加班的事情
We've spoken to the chief about doubling up on shifts,

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
但我想你也知道  一談到預算
but as I'm sure you know when it comes to budgets,

280
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,120
市政絕不妥協
the city's as tight as a fiddle string.

281
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,890
常言說得好"人窮面子不能窮
As they say, "Too poor to paint,

282
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,250
人倒架子不能倒"
too proud to whitewash."

283
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,570
我聞到了咖啡香味嗎
Is that coffee I smell brewing?

284
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,670
因為我現在非常想來一杯
Because Lord Almighty, I could sure use a cup.

285
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,710
我給你倒
I'll go pour you one.

286
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,330
非常感謝  太太
Much obliged, ma'am.

287
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,590
我操
Jesus fuck!

288
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,160
你能幫我穿襪子嗎
Can you help me with my socks?

289
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,170
我沒法...
I can't...

290
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,810
你在等什么
What you waiting for?

291
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,350
我以為昨晚是斯通去巡邏墳場
I thought Stone was on the graveyard shift last night.

292
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,860
你可真是個機靈的偵探啊  李
Well, that is some solid fucking detective work, Lee.

293
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,310
給我好好穿鞋就行了
Just help me with my boots.

294
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,470
鞋帶系雙結  閉上你的嘴
Double-knot the laces and shut the fuck up.

295
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,740
回去前我要把這個包好
I'm gonna pick that up before we head back.

296
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,340
-我們去哪  -你覺得呢
- Where are we going? - Where do you think?

297
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,100
-遠嗎  -你隨時可以回去
- Is it far? - You could always turn around.

298
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,770
不好意思  你是不是對我有意見  雅各布
I'm sorry, do you have some kind of problem with me, Jacob?

299
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,930
我見過的美國地盤比你多得多
I've seen a lot more of the pond than you,

300
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,760
聽我一句  跟著我沒有好處
so listen to me when I say no good will come from following me.

301
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,730
明白嗎
Get me?

302
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,910
但她派你來找我
But she sent you for me.

303
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,650
我可以告訴她你讓我滾犢子
I can tell her you told me to fuck off.

304
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,470
你是擔心她
Are you worried about her,

305
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,090
還是擔心自己
or yourself?

306
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,630
沒區別
Doesn't matter.

307
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,140
對我們大家都沒好處
Ends badly for all of us.

308

謝謝你的顧慮  雅各布
I appreciate your concern, Jacob,

309
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,510
但我想知道你的女主人要說什么

310
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,110
下午好  巴克利先生

舊金山警局

讓我們看看還有哪個臭小子能站起來

妓女都在樓上
The whores are upstairs.

328
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,480
把所有中國佬都給我抓起來
I want every slant-eyed john you can get your hands on.

329
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,650
你  你  起來
You, you. Get out of here.

330
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,940
怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

331
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,610
接著走  你不需要知道
Keep moving, you won't have to find out.

332
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,450
把中國佬帶去車那邊
Move the slants to the wagon.

333
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,600
怎么  你想玩玩
Yeah? You want to play?

334
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,780
天哪
Ah, Jesus.

335
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
你還在等什么
What are you waiting for?

336
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,620
快點  別管那個
Come on. Never mind that.

337
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,370
-照我說的做  -快走  走
- Do as I say and-- - Move along, move along.

338
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,000
快點
Come on.

339
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,850
你想用斧頭砍我  是不是
You want to pull a hatchet on me, do you?

340
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,050
出來  變態
Get out here, pervert!

341
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,370
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

342
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,100
趕緊干活  懂嗎
Just make yourself useful, will you?

343
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,720
警察
Police!

344
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,470
你還知道來
Nice of you to show up.

345
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
這里怎么了
What happened here?

346
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,720
他襲擊我
He drew on me.

347
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,980
我差點嚇得尿褲子
I almost pissed my fucking pants.

348
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,030
把其他中國佬都關進車里
Get the rest of these chinks in the wagon

349
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,620
-然后我們撤  -這是什么情況
- and let's get the fuck out of here. - What is meaning of this?

350
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,820
你是亞彩
You're Ah Toy.

351
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,820
-你認識我  -大家都認識你
- You know me. - Everyone knows you.

352

我得到了命令關閉這里

353
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,000
并且逮捕你

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,050
逮捕
Arrest?

355
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,430
因為什么
What for?

356
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,250
你在經營妓院
You're running a brothel.

357
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,260
妓院
Brothel?

358
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,590
不
No.

359
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,530
這是間寄宿屋  住的都是好姑娘
This a boarding house. These are good girls.

360
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,150
你跟法官說去吧
You can tell that to the judge.

361
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,650
如果我們做朋友
It would be better...

362
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,900
不是更好嗎
if we were friends, no?

363
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,450
朋友  是嗎
Friends, huh?

364
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,760
給您拜個早年
Early gift for Chinese New Year.

365
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,700
我們也要逮捕她嗎
Should we take her in too?

366
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,920
不必了
Nah.

367
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,610
我們完活了
I think we're done here.

368
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,660
謝謝您的配合  女士
Thank you for your cooperation, ma'am.

369
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,810
你有話想說
You got something you want to say?

370
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,540
不  無話可說
Nope, nothing I want to say.

371
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,950
聽著  我不知道你以為自己看見了什么
Look, I don't know what you think you saw in there--

372
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,250
我什么也沒想
I don't think anything.

373
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,050
你個自以為是的小賤貨
You preachy little shit!

374
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,600
你以為受點小賄就是問題嗎
You think taking a little money here is the problem?

375
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,660
睜大你的狗眼吧
Open your fucking eyes.

376
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,940
整個掃黃才是真正的問題
This whole bust is the problem.

377
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,880
你  我  那些中國佬  中國城警隊
You, me, the goddamn chinks, the Chinatown squad,

378
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,580
我們都只是別人棋盤中的棋子
we're all just pawns in someone else's game,

379
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,970
別大驚小怪了  我不過是想
so sue me if I'm getting my back scratched

380
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,330
在別人捅我刀子前撈點好處
before they stick a fucking knife in it!

381
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
那是非對錯呢
What about right and wrong?

382
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,090
"是非對錯"
"Right and wrong."

383
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,770
你到底為什么來這里  李
Why are you even here, Lee?

384
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,180
什么
What?

385
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,400
我猜薩瓦納也有很多罪犯吧
Well, I presume they've got plenty of criminals in Savannah.

386
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,890
為什么一個南方男孩要大老遠地
Why does a southern boy like you have to come all the way out here

387
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,610
跑到沒人認識你的地方當警察
where nobody knows who the fuck you are to become a cop?

388
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,390
聽好了
I'll tell you what.

389
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,490
你走你的陽關道
You stay the fuck out of my business,

390
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,010
我走我的獨木橋
and I'll stay the fuck out of yours.

391
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,940
還有其他需要嗎  夫人
Anything else, missus?

392
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,570
不用了  謝謝  雅各布  你下去吧
No, thank you, Jacob. That will be all.

393
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,980
所有美國人都有兩個家嗎
Does everyone in America have two homes?

394
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,600
樓是我父親的
My father owns the building.

395
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,110
你為什么派雅各布來找我
Why'd you send Jacob for me?

396
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,580
你為什么來
Why did you come?

397
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,650
我猜是好奇吧
Curious, I guess.

398
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,540
我只是...
I just...

399
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,450
我很后悔上次見面的情形
I regretted our last meeting.

400
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,160
我想讓你知道我不是那樣的人
I want you to know I'm not like that.

401
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,470
哪樣的人
Like what?

402
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,460
我說不好  只是覺得自己該道歉
I don't know, I just thought I should apologize.

403
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,300
真是個不咋地的道歉
That was a terrible apology.

404
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,880
你想喝點茶嗎
Would you like some tea?

405
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,260
行
Sure.

406
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,350
這些都是你畫的
You painted all of these?

407
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,020
嗯
Yeah.

408
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,780
你說你祖父是美國人
So, you said your grandfather was American.

409
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,780
他是個船長
He was a sea captain.

410
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,990
他為一家茶葉公司做海上貿易
He sailed the trade routes for a tea company.

411
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,750
有一年  他病了
One year he, uh-- he got sick.

412
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,380
沒辦法回到美國
He couldn't make the trip back home to America.

413
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,390
中國商人幫他安頓下來  請一名年輕護士
The Chinese merchants put him up with a young nurse

414
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,880
照顧他  度過了冬天
who cared for him through the winter.

415
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,550
他們墜入愛河  搬進一家小農場
They fell in love and moved to a small farm.

416
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,930
我出生后不久  祖母就去世了
My grandmother died when I was a baby,

417
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,490
但我祖父一直和我們生活在農場
but my grandfather lived on the farm with us

418
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,060
他是在我13歲那年去世的
until he passed when I was about 13...

419
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,650
他教我和我妹妹學英語
taught my sister and me English,

420
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,400
還給我們講了很多美國的故事
filled our heads with stories about America.

421
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,280
所以你才想來美國
So that's why you wanted to come to America.

422
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,910
我并不想來
I didn't want to come.

423
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,160
為什么還是來了
Then why did you?

424
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,470
我從沒給任何人看過這些畫
I've never shown those to anyone before.

425
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,510
為什么
Why not?

426
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,640
沒有人來過這里
No one's ever been here...

427
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,770
你是第一個
before you.

428
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,730
這樣的話
Well, um...

429
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,150
我很榮幸
I'm honored.

430
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,820
你應該感到榮幸
You should be.

431
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,920
你到底為什么會來
So why did you really come?

432
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,260
來美國嗎
To America?

433
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,720
這里
Here.

434
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,480
和你請我來的原因一樣
For the same reason you asked me to.

435
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,940
我不知道為什么叫你來
I don't know why I asked you to.

436
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,230
我覺得你知道
I think you do.

437
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,320
你很自信
You're very sure of yourself.

438
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,280
這是我的缺點
It's a problem.

439
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
謝謝你同意和我們見面
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

440
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,380
我們非常敬佩
We have great respect for what the Fung Hai

441
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,320
豐海在自己地盤上的成就
have accomplished in your territory,

442
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,280
我們有一個提議
and we have a proposition for you.

443
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,580
我不喜歡多嘴的賤人
I don't like when these bitches talk so much.

444
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,620
你喜歡聽她們啰嗦嗎
You like it when they talk so much?

445
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,170
也許你應該聽一聽
Perhaps you should listen.

446
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,550
豐海不需要任何人的幫助
The Fung Hai don't need help from anyone,

447
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,800
尤其是由婊子出面交涉的堂口
especially not some tong that lets the pussy do the talking.

448
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,890
其實
You know,

449
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,060
我早就預料到你會有這種反應
I had a feeling that you might feel this way.

450
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,770
賤人還在說話
The bitch is still talking.

451
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,770
所以我已經把你殺了
Which is why I already killed you.

452
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,410
你這個賤人
You bitch!

453
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,630
好了
So...

454
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,670
你剛剛說有個提議
I understand you have a proposition.

455
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,430
李勇
Li Yong.

456
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,100
剛剛是怎么回事
What the fuck was that?

457
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,320
他絕對不會和我們做交易的
He was never going to deal.

458
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,940
我們做了其他安排
We made other arrangements.

459
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,900
卻沒有告訴我
Without telling me, hmm?

460
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,610
為什么要告訴你
Why would I tell you?

461
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,180
如果我安排一次見面
See, if I set up a meet

462
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,870
而其中一方沒有離開
and someone doesn't walk out,

463
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,080
我的聲譽就毀了
that fucks with my reputation.

464
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,830
但如果我們告訴了你
And if we had told you,

465
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,420
你還會安排嗎
would you have done it?

466
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,210
我肯定會提高價錢
I definitely would have charged more.

467
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,390
李勇
Li Yong.

468
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,890
豐海
The Fung Hai?

469
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,480
是了結的手段
A means to an end.

470
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,060
也許吧
Maybe.

471
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,400
了結誰呢
But whose end?

472
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,900
你從哪里學會那樣打架的
Where did you learn to fight like that?

473
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,120
中國人都會那樣打架
All Chinese people can fight like that.

474
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,830
真的嗎
Really?

475
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,790
假的
No.

476
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,630
但你是...
But you're, uh...

477
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,710
惡棍
a highbinder...

478
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,550
黑幫殺手
a gang enforcer.

479
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,600
你不像是這樣的人
That doesn't seem like you.

480
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,600
我從船上下來后
I didn't have a lot of options

481
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,140
并沒有太多選擇的余地
when I got off the boat.

482
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,980
為了找到妹妹  加入合威是最好的選擇
Joining the Hop Wei was the best shot at finding my sister.

483
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,150
你妹妹
Your sister?

484
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,610
結果發現她不想被我找到
Turns out she didn't want to be found.

485
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,130
我嫁給我丈夫
I married my husband...

486
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,260
是為了拯救我父親的公司
to save my father's company.

487
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,280
我小的時候母親就去世了
My mother died when I was little,

488
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,600
所以基本上是我把妹妹們養大
so I practically raised my sisters,

489
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,900
當生意開始衰敗...
and when the business started to fail...

490
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,320
我不能讓她們承受那樣的結果
Well, I couldn't just let that happen to them.

491
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,550
布萊克家是舊金山的首富之一
The Blakes are one of the wealthiest families

492
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,450
而且塞繆爾是市長
in San Francisco, and Samuel was the mayor.

493
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,550
他和我父親是朋友
He was a friend of my father's,

494
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
母親去世后  他經常來探望
and he visited a lot after my mother died.

495
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,840
他總是保持微笑  還給我帶硬糖吃
He always had a smile and a hard candy for me.

496
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,800
隨著我逐漸長大
And as I got older...

497
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,590
他的笑容變了
his smile changed.

498
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,850
有了別的意義
It became something else.

499
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,950
但那份市政府合同
But that city contract

500
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
是讓我家免于破產的
was all that stood between my family

501
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,780
唯一解藥
and financial ruin.

502
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,930
我不記得具體是什么時候決定的
I don't remember exactly when I made the decision,

503
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,370
但有一天  我...
but one day I just...

504
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,620
回應了他的微笑
smiled back.

505
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,090
我猜...
I guess...

506
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,930
我像你一樣出賣了自己
I sold myself the same way you did.

507
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,970
這不適合你
Doesn't suit you.

508
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,810
被人占有
Being owned.

509
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,980
我覺得你我都不適合這種生活
I don't think it suits either of us.

510
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,200
起來  下一個是你
Come on, you're next.

511
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,220
你們撰寫報道時  最好說明
As you write your stories, you may want to note

512
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,640
這只是大規模突襲的開始
that this raid will be the first of many

513
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,120
市長要對中國城開展積極行動
as part of the mayor's aggressive Chinatown initiative.

514
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,390
你們絕對安全  先生們
No, you're perfectly safe, gentlemen.

515
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,000
不需要擔心
There's no need for concern.

516
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,610
-這樣就好看多了  -別動
- Look better after this. - Stay still.

517
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,760
-先生們  -市長先生
- Gentlemen. - Mr. Mayor.

518
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,180
看來一切進展順利
Well, it looks like we're making some progress.

519
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,680
好了
Now...

520
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,600
注意穿黑西裝的人
keep your eye on the ones in the black suits.

521
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,660
那是中國黑幫的裝束
That is the uniform of the Chinese gangsters.

522
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,250
他們是中國最冷酷的罪犯
These are the most hardened criminals in China.

523
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,090
來到這里的都是這種人
That's who's coming over here.

524
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,590
像美國這樣的
A land of laws and grace

525
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,380
法治與高雅之邦經受不住
like the United States is all too vulnerable

526
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,120
這些外國犯罪分子的侵蝕
to this foreign criminal element.

527
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,500
我們必須鐵面無情  先生們
We've got to harden our hearts, gentlemen.

528
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,430
-可以把那張印出來  -等等
- You can print that. - Oh, wait.

529
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,710
等等  等一下
Wait, hold on.

530
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,250
我們拍張照吧
Let's get a picture.

531
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,060
弗拉納根局長  把你的人都叫來
Chief Flannagan, let's get all of your men together.

532
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,480
中國城警隊全體隊員
The whole Chinatown squad.

533
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,020
我想把你們的辛勤工作
I want to document the good work

534
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,070
-記錄下來  -比爾  麥克勞德
- you're doing here. - Bill, McLeod,

535
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,470
哈里森  斯通  過來
Harrison, Stone, come here.

536
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,590
市長先生
Mr. Mayor?

537
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,820
我們剛剛經歷了戰爭  拯救了美國
We just fought a war to save America.

538
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,280
不能轉過頭就將這個國家交給中國人
We're not gonna turn around and hand it over to the Chinese.

539
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,200
我們要把這些人趕回老家去
We need to send these boys back where they came from.

540
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,660
要是繼續給他們剪頭發
Well, you keep cutting off their hair,

541
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,070
他們就回不去了
they won't be able to go back.

542
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,190
閉嘴  李
Shut up, Lee.

543
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,780
你說什么  警官
What was that, officer?

544
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,200
這是中國的法律  巴克利先生
It's the law in China, Mr. Buckley.

545
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,590
根據皇帝的旨意
By decree of the Emperor, all men are required

546
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,140
男人得留長辮
to wear those braided queues.

547
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,790
他不是有意的  先生
He doesn't mean anything by it, sir.

548
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,960
李警官就是一個歷史迷而已
Officer Lee is just a bit of a history buff, that's all.

549
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,310
-李  是嗎  -是的  先生
- Lee, is it? - Yes, sir.

550
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,210
李警官  過來拍照
Get in the picture, Officer Lee.

551
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
不  謝了  先生
Uh, no thank you, sir.

552
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,480
我真的不喜歡拍照
I don't really like having my picture taken.

553
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,130
快去拍照  李
Get in the fucking picture, Lee.

554
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,260
別動
Hold still.

555
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,560
我一直想問你
Been meaning to ask you:

556
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,240
你的臉怎么了
What the hell happened to your face?

557
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,480
說來話長
Long story.

558
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,900
我可能不想聽
It's one I probably don't want to hear.

559
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,870
應該是吧
Probably not.

560
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,610
大家都別動
All right, everybody stand still.

561
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,030
別動
Nobody move.

562
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,450
別動
Nobody move.

563
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,760
來自東方的外來疾病
Exotic diseases from the Orient.

564
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,390
中國幫派暴力正在蔓延
Chinese gang violence that's spilling

565
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,310
進入白人社區
into white neighborhoods.

566
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,580
空地上都是失業的美國人
Sandlots full of unemployed Americans.

567
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,090
目前可能是區域性的  但如果不加以控制
It may feel local today, but if it goes unchecked,

568
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,110
黃禍會像瘟疫一樣蔓延全國
the yellow peril will spread across the country like a plague.

569
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,090
廉價報社更好賣
The Penny Press is an easier sell,

570
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,260
流通量也很大
and their circulation is substantial.

571
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,320
但我知道你為什么
But I understand why you would think

572
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,240
想讓美聯社報道這個新聞
that the Associated Press should be covering this story.

573
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,690
中國對美國價值觀的攻擊
"The Chinese Assault on American Values."

574
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,940
這是標題
That's your headline.

575
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,710
請你上車好嗎
Would you just get in, please?

576
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,310
謝謝你送我
Thanks for the ride.

577
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,890
真高端
Fancy.

578
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,040
大家都說
You know, everyone always said

579
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,690
你是個功夫奇才
you were a kung fu prodigy.

580
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,980
我覺得你真正的天賦
I think your real genius...

581
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,860
是給我找麻煩
Is finding ways to screw up my life.

582
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,960
我也很高興見到你
It's good to see you too.

583
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,470
你剛到這里
You just got here,

584
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,380
就加入了我的敵對幫派
and already you've joined my enemies,

585
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,800
坐了牢
gotten yourself arrested--

586
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,260
你上的不止是白人妹子
not only are you fucking a white lady,

587
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,310
那可是市長夫人
you're fucking the mayor's wife.

588
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,250
下周你還打算干嗎
What are you going to do next week?

589
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,190
你這么一說
Well, when you put it like that--

590
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,400
-我說了讓你離開  -我是打算走的
- I told you to leave. - Oh, and I was going to,

591
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,110
但后來我想起來你不是我的老板
but then I remembered you're not my boss.

592
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,610
你真的認為父親讓你來美國
Do you really think Father would have wanted you

593
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,640
就是讓你被殺嗎
to cross the salt just to get yourself killed?

594
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,320
他想讓你在美國佬的監獄被關到死
He'd want you rotting away in a duck prison?

595
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,580
對了  謝謝救我出來
Oh, thanks, by the way, for getting me out.

596
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,490
真是太好了  救了我一命
That was great. Really saved my ass.

597
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,230
一如既往
As usual.

598
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,940
我救你最后一次
I'm gonna do it one final time.

599
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,780
送你回家
I'm sending you home.

600
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,600
{\an8}太平洋郵輪

601
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,500
跟我一起走
Come with me.

602
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,220
阿杉
Ah Sahm...

603
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,300
我回不去了
I'm never going back.

604
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,990
-我在中國誰也不是  -不
- I'm nobody in China... - No,

605
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,810
-你不走我就不走  -你在這里誰也不是
- I'm not going without you. - And you're nobody here.

606
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,560
堂口之間必有一戰
There is going to be a war between the tongs...

607
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,730
如果你站錯了隊
and if you're on the wrong side,

608
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,860
我不會猶豫的
I won't hesitate.

609
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,820
我不能猶豫
I can't.

610
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,910
你的船明天出發
Your boat leaves tomorrow.

611
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,250
你說得對
You were right.

612
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,500
什么
What?

613
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,970
我不應該讓你嫁給孫楊來救我
I should never have let you marry Sun Yang to save me.

614
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,720
我應該拼命救你的
I should have fought to save you.

615
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,940
我不會再犯這種錯誤了
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

616
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,620
我以為你回家睡覺了
I figured you'd be home and in bed by now.

617
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,450
你有四個孩子的時候再說這話吧
Come and talk to me when you've got four kids.

618
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,000
不是五個嗎
I thought it was five?

619
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,460
操  我老是把伊桑忘了
Fuck me. I keep forgetting Ethan.

620
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,340
他也是我的最愛
He's my favorite too.

621
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,170
喝點什么嗎
You want a drink?

622
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,630
還是說你不喝酒了
Or don't you drink anymore?

623
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,430
你也把這個嗜好也留在喬治亞了
You left all that behind in Georgia too?

624
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,970
恰恰相反
Oh, on the contrary,

625
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,450
我媽最煩我了
I'm the only hell my mama ever raised.

626
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,720
那就喝一杯吧
Well, come on, then.

627
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,430
兩杯
Two.

628
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,150
說吧
Well, let's go. Out with it.

629
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,570
說什么
With what?

630
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,490
我不知道
Oh, I don't know...

631
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,660
但你總是有問題
But it's always something with you.

632
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,920
好吧
Right, well, um...

633
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,590
我只是想道個歉
I guess I just wanted to apologize.

634
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,800
道歉我喜歡
Well, this sounds promising.

635
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,980
你是我的上級
You are the superior officer,

636
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,650
比我更了解道上的事
and you know the streets better than I do.

637
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,050
我不應該質疑你的
I shouldn't be questioning you.

638
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,390
沒錯
You're damn right about that.

639
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,600
你真是一只奇怪的鳥  李
You're a strange bird, Lee.

640
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,650
為什么
How's that?

641
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,540
首先
Well, for starters,

642
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,450
大多數警察不會掏死人的肚子
most cops don't dig around in the guts of dead men.

643
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,450
其實吧
Well...

644
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,120
我之前一直住在農場
I spent my whole life on a farm.

645
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,680
牛死了  就得檢查一下體內
Cows start dying, you gotta look inside,

646
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,750
看看它們的死因
see what's killing them.

647
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,120
人不是動物
People aren't animals.

648
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,170
不是嗎
Aren't we?

649
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,270
我們不過是被大腦欺騙了
We've just got these bigger brains that trick us

650
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,800
自以為不是動物
into thinking we're something else.

651
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,760
給
Here you are.

652
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,560
記我賬上
Put it on my tab.

653
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,390
你是好孩子
Look, you're a good kid...

654
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,230
也會成為一個好警察的
and you're gonna be a fine cop.

655
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,480
我能看出來  因為我曾經也是
And I should know. I used to be one.

656
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,320
總有一天
One of these days,

657
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,160
我們會調離中國城
we'll get ourselves reassigned out of Chinatown

658
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,910
去做些真正的警察工作
and we'll go off and do some real police work.

659
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,340
好嗎
All right?

660
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,620
聽起來不錯  隊長
Sounds good, Sergeant.

661
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:46,960
但在那之前
But until then,

662
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,830
低調一點
you keep your head down.

663
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,880
活下來就行
You do what you have to to survive.

664
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,760
在中國城巡邏
This Chinatown beat...

665
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,470
黑白兩道能讓你有
there's about 100 different ways it can bury you...

666
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,890
將近一百種死法
on both sides of the line.

667
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,680
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

668
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,890
明白
I do.

669
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,230
不  你不明白
No, you don't.

670
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,520
暫時還不明白
Not yet.

671
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,860
但你會明白的
But you will.

672
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,590
很抱歉  雖然你還沒喝完  但我得走了
I'm sorry to leave you before you finish your drink,

673
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,740
我有約
but I've got an appointment.

674
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,470
加我一個
Deal me in.

675
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,240
你知道菲茨說我不能再給你籌碼了  比爾
You know Fitz says I can't give you any more markers, Bill.

676
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,850
買入價十塊
The buy-in is $10.

677
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,020
這有三十
Here's 30.
